        <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">Extrasynaptome Data Repository is a web application concentrated on network neuroscience and connectomics of the nervous systems &#8208; such as of a 1mm long roundworm called Caenorhabditis elegans. That is to aid bioengineering research focused on human beingâ€™s brain functioning. The web application will act as a centralized database repository that will be able to curate, store and visualise the wired and wireless connectomes of neuron network systems to perform network analyses and expand on the already existing knowledge.</p>
        <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">This project is the first centralised resource for studying a class of critically important biological networks. With the potential for expansion and the aim to form a larger grant application, this project aspires to serve an international userbase to support and accelerate research in multiple subfields of neuroscience. </p>

          <div class="space-y-1 lg:space-y-3">
            <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">I completed and received my Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge where I worked at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in the areas of computational neuroscience and bioinformatics. I have conducted research and consultancy works for multiple organisations including the Open University, the University of Oxford, the European Space Agency, and ARM Holdings. But my current research interests lie in the development and application of computational tools for biological and medical problems, with a particular interest in the areas of neuroscience, ageing, and cryobiology.</p>
            <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">This web application is a continuation of my interest which sparked when I started to work on my Ph.D. thesis. By accumulating the knowledge and all of my ideas I had that the time I decided to produce a technology that would allow me to pursue the path of research in an attempt to contribute to the field of medicine. Through extensive research, the results had shown me that the fields of neurology and psychiatry suffer from high costs to treat its patients (due to the ageing population) in the UK due to inefficient treatments preceded by the lack of quality technological tools and data information.</p>
            <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">By developing Extrasynaptome Data Repository I hope that the field of medicine will benefit from it. My wish for this project is to transform it into a robust and flexible bank of data information from which competent people shall be able to make their qualified conclusions. Through this technology, I would want to improve the environment in which the patients shall be treated under better treatment procedures with experts backed by reliable, accessible and up&#8208;to&#8208;date information. Let this project be the beginning of that.</p>

          <div class="space-y-1 lg:space-y-3">
            <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">Ahoj, I am Oliver Olah intern software developer of the Extrasynaptome Data Repository project. I am a second&#8208;year MSc student at Cardiff Metropolitan University where I study Information Technology Management. I have become a part of this project in July 2021 after an offer from Cardiff Metâ€™s Programme Director for the Computing and Information MSc programmes in the Department of Computing Dr Ambikesh Jayal and the founder of this project Dr Barry Bentley. I took this opportunity simply to learn but also because it was a part of my course curriculum. </p>
            <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">Neuroinformatics is a very serious and always popular area of study because it brings together the worlds of information technology and neurology. It is an area that is dynamic and rich in producing new methods and processes for improvement that can even have a global outreach. Most importantly, it helps people that need treatment with quality assuring their health and well&#8208;being.</p>
            <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">That was not the only thing that crossed my mind when I was considering working on this project. 
              Being an MSc student in IT Management I knew I had to find something worthwhile from which I 
              would benefit also in the long&#8208;distant future. Something where I would be able to learn hard skills as 
              well as hard skills such as programming or project management. This was it. Being a part of this 
              project has taught me to apply the knowledge which I hoped to learn in the future once I would enter 
              the industry. This opportunity has speeded up this process. Because I was the only developer (at least 
              during the first year of production) in the project I had to rely only on myself and on Dr Bentleyâ€™s 
              pieces of advice. That brought the opportunity for me to learn and fail as much as I could to progress. 
              I have got the opportunity to learn to program on a completely new level by also understanding the 
              mechanics in the background; moreover, it allowed me to manage the whole process of the 
              development that requires managerial skills as well as technical to conduct the project correctly also 
              in constructive communication with my supervisor (also Dr Bentley). Despite the initial doubts, I took 
              this challenge to see where it will take me no matter how difficult it might have seen at the beginning. 
              Believe me, I did everything I could. Well, see for yourself &#8208; the product of my effort. I hope you will 
              enjoy this web application.</p>
