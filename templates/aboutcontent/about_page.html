        <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">The aim of the Collaborative Extrasynaptome Data Repository (CEDaR) is to centralise and organise all current data on chemical interactions between neurons that occur outside of synaptic connections in the nervous system, with participation from the wider neuroscience community, and provide visualisation and analysis tools to reveal the hidden “wireless” networks of long-range interactions between neurons that sit alongside the “wired” synaptic connectome. </p>
        <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">Starting with the monoamine and neuropeptide networks of the roundworm <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</span>, this project is the first centralised resource for studying a class of critically important biological networks. With the potential for expansion to cover multiple species, this project aspires to serve an international user base to support and accelerate research in neuroscience.</p>

          <div class="space-y-1 lg:space-y-3">
            <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">Ahoj, I am Oliver Olah intern software developer of the Extrasynaptome Data Repository project. I am a second&#8208;year MSc student at Cardiff Metropolitan University where I study Information Technology Management. I have become a part of this project in July 2021 after an offer from Cardiff Met’s Programme Director for the Computing and Information MSc programmes in the Department of Computing Dr Ambikesh Jayal and the founder of this project Dr Barry Bentley. I took this opportunity to learn and explore new possibilities in programming and project management to gain a valuable experience in a field from which many people worldwide can benefit. . </p>
            <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">In my perspective, neuroinformatics is a popular but very serious area of study because it brings together the worlds of information technology and neuroscience. It is an area that is dynamic and rich in producing new healthcare methods and processes for improvement that can even have a global reach to benefit people of any age category.</p>
            <p class="leading-6 lg:text-lg">That was not the only thing that crossed my mind when I was considering working on this project. Being an MSc student in IT Management I knew I had to find something worthwhile from which I would benefit also in the long-distant future. Something where I would be able to learn hard skills as well as soft skills. This was it. Being a part of this project has taught me to apply the knowledge which I hoped to learn in the future once I would enter the industry. This opportunity has speeded up this process. Because I was the only developer (at least during the first year of production) in the project I had to rely only on myself and on Dr Bentley’s advice. That brought the opportunity for me to learn and fail as much as I could to progress. I have got the opportunity to learn to program on a completely new level by also understanding deeper mechanics of it in the background; moreover, it allowed me to manage the whole process of the development that requires managerial skills as well as technical skills to conduct the project correctly in constructive communication with my supervisor (also Dr Bentley). Despite the initial doubts, I took this challenge to see where it would take me no matter how difficult it might have appeared at the beginning. Believe me, I did everything I could. Well, see for yourself &#8208; the product of my effort. I hope you will enjoy this web application.</p>
