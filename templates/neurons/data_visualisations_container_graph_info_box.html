      <p>This is the first version of a visualisation that represents a synaptic network of the <span class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</span> roundworm. The visualisation was built using the d3js library. This specific type of graph is called a force layout diagram. Its main characteristic is that it is made of <span class="font-semibold">nodes</span> and <span class="font-semibold">links</span>. In total, there are 302 nodes (neurons) that link (edges) with one another creating connectome pairs. The links represent two types of synaptic connections. The <span class="text-gapLinkColor font-semibold">orange-coloured</span> link is of the type gap junction transmission <span class="font-semibold">(GAP)</span> and the <span class="text-synLinkColor font-semibold">blue-coloured</span> link is of the type synaptic transmission <span class="font-semibold">(SYN)</span>. There are three nodes that are unconnected. The nodes are split also by their colours which represent their <span class="font-semibold">types</span>.</p>
      <p>In the future, the plans are to improve the interactivity and informativeness of this diagram. More information for its exploration will be included, with interactive elements and controls to allow the graph to be visually personalised to access the bits of information which are necessary.</p>
